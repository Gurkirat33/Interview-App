# Real-Time Coding Interview Platform

## Overview

The Real-Time Coding Interview Platform is an advanced web application designed to streamline and enhance the experience of conducting coding interviews. It offers a robust set of features that enable interviewers to evaluate candidates effectively in a live, collaborative environment. The platform simulates the real-world coding interview process, allowing both interviewers and candidates to interact in real-time with tools that facilitate communication, coding, and assessment.

## Features

### 1. **Live Coding Environment**
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Both the interviewer (admin) and the candidate can write, edit, and execute code simultaneously in a shared coding environment. This ensures that the interview process is interactive and closely mirrors a real-world coding scenario.
- **Multi-Language Support:** The platform supports various programming languages, enabling interviews to be conducted in the candidate's preferred language. The integrated code editor provides syntax highlighting and immediate output display, helping both parties to focus on the problem at hand without technical distractions.

### 2. **Role-Based Access and Controls**
- **Interviewer Privileges:**
  - **Session Monitoring:** The admin can monitor the candidate’s screen, checking if the candidate is in full-screen mode and whether the browser window is focused. This helps maintain the integrity of the interview process.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Interviewers can provide real-time feedback, add remarks, and guide the candidate through the interview process. The admin’s interface includes tools to control the flow of the session, ensuring a structured and fair interview.
  - **Control Features:** The admin has additional controls, such as pausing the session, giving hints, or locking certain parts of the interface to simulate specific interview conditions.

### 3. **Real-Time Communication**
- **Video Integration:** The platform includes video calls, enabling a comprehensive interview experience. This allows for questions, clarifications, and instructions to be communicated seamlessly.
- **Live Feedback:** The platform enables interviewers to provide live feedback and hints directly within the coding environment, ensuring that the interview remains interactive and responsive.
